\section{What it offers}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{OCCAM}
\framesubtitle{What does it have to offer?}

\begin{itemize}

\item Network of experts in mathematical modelling.
\pause

\item Fresh look at the problems.\\
Ask the ``right'' questions $\to$ New approaches.
\pause

\item Recurrence of mathematics in different fields (Universality).\\
{\tiny (Port techniques from one field to another)}

\end{itemize}
