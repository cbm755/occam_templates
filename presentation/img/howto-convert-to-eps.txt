Converting from .jpg to .eps
============================
Various ways, some result in very large .eps files.  One nice way is the program "jpeg2ps".  I've used that to convert the jpeg files here.

Converting from .png to .eps
============================
I used to use "bmeps" but I don't seem to have it installed on my laptop anymore.  I used a website http://www.tlhiv.org/rast2vec/ for image.png.  Update: downloaded sam2p, works great.

In general
==========
Convert (from ImageMagick) creates poor .eps files from bitmaps with no compression, so they are often very large.  Perhaps there are command line options to fix this, but I haven't tried.
