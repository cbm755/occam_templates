A template for making OCCAM posters and presentations
=====================================================

OCCAM poster and presentation templates are maintained on GitHub.

The preferred way of accessing them is with git by opening a terminal and typing:

  git clone https://github.com/cbm755/occam_templates.git

Later you can type "git pull" to download the latest changes.

Notes
=====
As least on my machine, Kamel's poster template has the text color the same as the background.

I've added some changes from Joseph Parker (temp_poster_jp.tex et al), but I haven't had a chance to compare.
